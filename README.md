# Whack a Ghoul

A simple mini-game where you boop Ghouls for treats, built for the [DCL Regenesis Labs Vibe Coding Hackathon](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/dcl-bring-your-vibe/detail).

I found out about this competition roughly 24 hours before the deadline. I used a lot of AI gen to get this project working, including:

- ChatGPT for brainstorming and inspiration
- ChatGPT / Claude via Cursor IDE for code assistance
- Stable Diffusion for mockup/concept art
- https://elevenlabs.io for sound effects

I talk more about my workflow in this video: [https://youtu.be/lUuK7iOSg5k](https://youtu.be/lUuK7iOSg5k)

This project was created with the Decentrland Creator Hub and Cursor IDE, starting with an SDK7 template repository I use for most projects. More info on the template in the various links below.

## Repository Overview

This repository is split in the following folders:

- `/assets` - contains all assets and textures before being exported to `glTF`. This includes all `blend` and `FBX` files, as well as full-size source textures.
  - `/assets/models` - source files for each model in the scene, including full res textures
  - `/assets/fonts` - any fonts used in the scene and accompanying media
  - `/assets/tex` - asset agnostic textures used across the scene
- `/config` - useful info such as import/export settings, UVPackMaster Presets, shader templates
- `/dcl` - the DCL scene to be deployed. Exported glTF files are in `/dcl/models` along with a `tex` folder of optimised textures
- `/docs` - extra info on relevant topics, eg asset creation
- `/firebase` - the code for the hosted scoreboard
- `/reference` - screenshots, previs, reference pictures used during asset creation
- `/scripts` - various bash/blender/bat utility scripts
